# Uniform-convergence-may-be-unable-to-explain-generalization-in-deep-learning
Study of a research paper on deep learning and the generalization abilities of overparametrized models that cannot be explained by Uniform Convergence properties. We created an exercise revolving around this subject, an oral presentation supported by a powerpoint.
